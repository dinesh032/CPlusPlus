//Containers are of 3 kinds,
//- Sequence containers(array & linked list) - vector, deque, list, forward list, array
//- Associative containers(binary tree) - set, multiset, map, multimap
//- Unordered containers(Hash table) - unordered set/multiset, unordered map/multimap

// common member functions for all containers
//container.empty()
//container.size()
//container.clear()


// Deque container
// It's like double ended vector. Can insert/remove on the both ends i.e begin & end
//deq.push_back() & deq.push_front() are two functions to insert at 2 ends
//properties same as vector
